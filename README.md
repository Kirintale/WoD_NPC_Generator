# WoD_NPC_Generator
An NPC Generator for WoD. I've included the Eclipse settings as this currently only works through eclipse

The basic premise of this program is be able to generate NPCs quickly for any WoD game.
By running the program through eclipse and setting to run through the command line you are asked a series of requests, these are:
1 - Which type of character (Human, Vampire20, MageRevised...)
2 - The stat line to use
3 - The archetype of the character.

This will generate a premade character for you to use. It's worth looking at the character and changing the points slightly to your own taste and spending the freebie points

How the program works:
1 - Each game has different available skills and attributes, the first section accounts for this.
2 - The stat line dictates how many points the character will get (much like creating a new character)
3 - The archetype dictates what skills the NPC will split its points between. Example a Brawler will put the most points in physical abilities, the only really put it in brawl and intimidate.
